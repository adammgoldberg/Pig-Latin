//        You need to implement a category on NSString with one method: -(NSString *)stringByPigLatinization.
//        
//        This method will return the pig latin version of the string is called on, in the sense that all words will be turned into their pig latin version and there will be a space between each of them (don't worry about keeping the original spacing and punctuation right now).
//

//                                                                                                                                                                                                          
//                                                                                                                                                                                                          You'll need to separate the string into words, and this is often called tokenization in language processing.
